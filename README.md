# Human-Activity-Recognition
Human activity recognition, or HAR, has been a significant goal of computer vision as well as it is a challenging time series classification task. It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data and traditionally involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning model. Recently, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks have shown capable and even achieve state-of-the-art results by automatically learning features from the raw sensor data. This paper propose a Multi-Head ConvLSTM to build a deep neural architecture for better accuracy of HAR ,where each head of the model reads the input time steps using a different sized kernel. A three-headed model may have three different kernel sizes allowing the model to read and interpret the sequence data at three different resolutions. The interpretations from all three heads are then concatenated within the model and interpreted by a two fully-connected layer before a prediction is made.
